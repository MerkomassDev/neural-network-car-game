## Introduction

The Neural Network Car Game is a JavaScript-based project that utilizes neural networks to create an autonomous driving simulation. The goal of the game is to train the neural networks to navigate the game environment and drive the car without human intervention.

## Features

- Neural network-based car driving simulation
- Parallelization for improved performance
- Saving and discarding of the car's brain
- Traffic simulation
- Neural network visualizer

## Installation

To run the Neural Network Car Game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/MerkomassDev/neural-network-car-game.git
   ```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the game running, you can interact with it using the following controls:

- Use the arrow keys to control the car manually.
- The neural network controls the car automatically.

Feel free to experiment with different settings, tweak the neural network parameters, and observe the car's behavior.
